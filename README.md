 # Coding Interview Patterns
___

## Overview:
- This repository has the objective to help all the students and developers that are trying to lend a job in any programming role.
- My inspiration to create this repository came from the struggle of finding good and easy to understand content on Algorithms for Java Developers.
- After searching many materials I've found the Coding Interview Patterns book by Alex Xu & Shaun Gunawardane published by ByteByteGo.
- As a Java Developer and enthusiast the book was helpful but still, since it was in Python, I've decided to create this Repo as personal study and in order to help other that may need.

## How does it works?
- In this repo you'll find packages related to each pattern and, inside each package you'll find different problems and variations that are solved using that pattern.
- The order that you'll follow doesn't matter but this repo was developed using ByteByteGo's suggestion.
- If you are new to leetcode or to algorithms, I suggest you to follow the same order listed in the image below:
